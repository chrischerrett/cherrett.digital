                      </p>
                      <p>
                          It’s important to say that we don’t simply want more of what we’ve <em>already</em> got, or more of what we <em>already</em> know. We want to <strong>enhance</strong> the services we offer our clients by bringing ambitious individuals together who offer something new and exciting.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          If this sounds like you, be sure to <strong>register your interest today</strong> (irrespective of the roles listed below). Don't wait for us to discover you &#8212; come and discover us!

                <h3 class="new-role">Solutions Architect</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        We always inform our <a href="/full-stack-development">development</a> process with a <strong>comprehensive specification</strong> from the outset. Our <a href="/digital-service-design">digital service design</a> package ensures that our client's goals are totally aligned with the objectives of the project. It also helps us qualify requirements and ensures we present the correct solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But come on... <strong>we didn't need to tell you that</strong>, because you're the one who demonstrates a passion to take ideas and run with it; exploring the problem and delivering a fully-fledged specification that describes the solution. One that's both <strong>client-friendly</strong> and <strong>valuable to developers</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you've been a developer for a while but you're looking to step back from the day-to-day code and put your experience into designing the solution, rather than implementing it, then we'd love to hear from you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, saying that, this role could easily be combined with the <strong>Web Applications Developer</strong>'s duties too. It really depends how involved you want to be in either phase. But you don't need to decide that now... all you need to decide is whether to <a href="#apply">contact us</a> today.

                <h3 class="new-role">User Interface Architect</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Do you have what it takes to <strong>make everyones day a little bit easier</strong>; to make the complex seem simple?</p>
                    <p>Code is important, but code is invisible. No matter how elegant the code, end users never see it. End users don't interact with code; they engage in a sequence of micro-interactions to <strong>achieve their goals</strong>.</p>
                    <p>That UI determines how positivly they judge their <a href="/digital-service-design">experience with a website or application</a>, and that's why this role is critical in the pursuit of high-quality software. But you <strong>already knew that</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Our next User Interface Architect is someone who:
                      <ul class="list">
                        <li>Understands and empathise with end users.</li>
                        <li>Knows how to select the right tools for the job.</li>
                        <li>Understands how the technology is applied, and that good design is not simply what it looks like; "design is how it works".</li>
                        <li>Has a creative flair that traverses all layers of the stack.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>We don't ask that you know how to use certain software packages. <strong>That's your domain</strong>. All we ask is that you can demonstrate an efficient and valuable route to delivering great user interfaces that our clients (and their customers) love to use every day.</p>

                    <p>
                        This is not a generic job board... and we're not looking for a generic developer. We're looking for someone who'll fit in perfectly with <strong>a team that encapsulates all of the above</strong> (and all of the below). Our next Web Applications Developer is someone who:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <ul class="list">
                        <li>Remains an avocate for the end-user throughout.</li>
                        <li>Has demonstrable care and appreciation for all layers of the stack, with minimal guidance required.</li>
                        <li>Designs and builds for longevity.</li>
                        <li>Sees errors and bugs as a challenge to solve, rather than a sign of defeat.</li>
                        <li>Has an awareness that allows him or her to think beyond the current application.</li>
                        <li>Loves to bring new ideas to the table and challenge “default thinking”.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With regards to specific technical skills, we are looking for someone with...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <ul class="list">
                        <li>3+ years’ experience in frontend and backend development.</li>
                        <li>Expertise in object-oriented programming and some experience with open source MVC frameworks, such as Laravel.</li>
                        <li>Solid understanding of frontend development practices and JavaScript frameworks, such as jQuery and Vue.js.</li>
                        <li>Some experience with CMS systems and packages.</li>
                        <li>Some experience with Linux in a DevOps environment.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what <em>really</em> matters is what you bring, not what we do already. You've got the skills to role with it!
