                      <p>It’s important to say that we’re not simply looking for more of what we’ve <em>already</em> got, or more of what we <em>already</em> know. We want to <strong>do better</strong> for our clients.</p>
                      <p>If this sounds like you, be sure to <strong>register your interest today</strong> (irrespective of the roles listed below). Don't wait for us to discover you &#8212; come and discover us!</p>

                    <p>This person will have a key role to play in developing a commercial SaaS platform for a key client, which is about to launch ‘v2’ after four years of success to date. This product crosses over with some exciting new projects for the same client, necessitating more hands on deck!</p>
                    <p>We're not looking for a generic developer. We're looking for someone who'll work perfectly alongside <strong>a team that encapsulates all of the below</strong>. This person is someone who:</p>
                    <p>
                      <ul class="list">
                        <li>Remains an advocate for the end-user throughout.</li>
                        <li>Has demonstrable care and appreciation for all layers of the stack, with minimal guidance required.</li>
                        <li>Designs and builds for longevity.</li>
                        <li>Sees errors and bugs as a challenge to solve, rather than a sign of defeat.</li>
                        <li>Has an awareness that allows him or her to think beyond the current application.</li>
                        <li>Loves to bring new ideas to the table and challenge “default thinking”.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>With regards to specific technical skills, we are looking for someone with...</p>
                    <p>
                      <ul class="list">
                        <li>Demonstrable experience with Laravel is hugely advantageous (but not essential if well-versed in PHP, MVC frameworks and API development)</li>
                        <li>Container management experience (Kubernetes/Docker)</li>
                        <li>Solid understanding of frontend development practices and modern JavaScript libraries such React or Vue.js.</li>
                        <li>Exposure to Azure and cloud hosted applications in a Linux-based DevOps-type environment.</li>
                        <li>Experience working in a small team and/or independently from scratch.</li>

                    <p>It will be hugely advantageous if this person was based in Dorset or Hampshire. But what <em>really</em> matters is the approach you bring to the table. Ultimately, you've got the ingenuity to pick it up and role with it!</p>
