                      <h1>Software Engineering Jobs</h1>
                      <p>We're looking for <strong>inquisitive developers and ambitious self-starters</strong> who want to make a difference in our client's industries. If you’re looking for something new and exciting then we'd love to hear from you.</p>
                      <p>It’s important to say that we’re not simply looking for more of what we’ve <em>already</em> got, or more of what we <em>already</em> know. We want to <strong>do better</strong> for our clients.</p>
                      <p>If this sounds like you, be sure to <strong>register your interest today</strong> (irrespective of the roles listed below). Don't wait for us to discover you &#8212; come and discover us!</p>
                      <p>That being said, we are looking for a particular <strong>Web Applications Engineer</strong> at the moment...</p>

                <p><strong>Contract (6 months) &#8226; Outside IR35 &#8226; Rate TBC</strong></p>
                <div>
                    <p>This person will have a key role to play in developing a commercial SaaS platform for a key client, which is about to launch ‘v2’ after four years of success to date. This product crosses over with some exciting new projects for the same client, necessitating more hands on deck!</p>
                    <p>We're not looking for a generic developer. We're looking for someone who'll work perfectly alongside <strong>a team that encapsulates all of the below</strong>. This person is someone who:</p>
                    <p>
                      <ul class="list">
                        <li>Remains an avocate for the end-user throughout.</li>
                        <li>Has demonstrable care and appreciation for all layers of the stack, with minimal guidance required.</li>
                        <li>Designs and builds for longevity.</li>
                        <li>Sees errors and bugs as a challenge to solve, rather than a sign of defeat.</li>
                        <li>Has an awareness that allows him or her to think beyond the current application.</li>
                        <li>Loves to bring new ideas to the table and challenge “default thinking”.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>With regards to specific technical skills, we are looking for someone with...</p>
                    <p>
                      <ul class="list">
                        <li>Demonstrable experience with Laravel is hugely advantageous (but not essential if well-versed in PHP, MVC frameworks and API development)</li>
                        <li>Container management experience (Kubernetes/Docker)</li>
                        <li>Solid understanding of frontend development practices and modern JavaScript libraries such React or Vue.js.</li>
                        <li>Exposure to Azure and cloud hosted applications in a Linux-based DevOps-type environment.</li>
                        <li>Experience working in a small team and/or independently from scratch.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>It will be hugely advantageous if this person was based in Dorset or Hampshire. But what <em>really</em> matters is the approach you bring to the table. Ultimately, you've got the ingenuity to pick it up and role with it!</p>

                <h3 class="new-role">User Interface Architect</h3>
                <p><strong>Register your interest!</strong></p>
                <div>
                    <p>Do you have what it takes to <strong>make everyones day a little bit easier</strong>; to make the complex seem simple?</p>
                    <p>Code is important, but code is invisible. No matter how elegant the code, end users never see it. End users don't interact with code; they engage in a sequence of micro-interactions to <strong>achieve their goals</strong>.</p>
                    <p>That UI determines how positivly they judge their <a href="/digital-service-design">experience with a website or application</a>, and that's why this role is critical in the pursuit of high-quality software. But you <strong>already knew that</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Our next User Interface Architect is someone who:
                      <ul class="list">
                        <li>Understands and empathise with end users.</li>
                        <li>Knows how to select the right tools for the job.</li>
                        <li>Understands how the technology is applied, and that good design is not simply what it looks like; "design is how it works".</li>
                        <li>Has a creative flair that traverses all layers of the stack.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>We don't ask that you know how to use certain software packages. <strong>That's your domain</strong>. All we ask is that you can demonstrate an efficient and valuable route to delivering great user interfaces that our clients (and their customers) love to use every day.</p>
