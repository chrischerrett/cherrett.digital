                       <p>Whilst <a href="/digital-service-design">digital service design</a> identifies the correct solution, and the method of implementation, sometimes you just need an <strong>experienced developer</strong> to solve a problem or turn an existing idea into a working website or application.</p>

                <h2>How We Work</h2>

                <p>Whilst we specialise in the design and development of websites and applications as components of <a href="/digital-service-design">digital service design</a>, our experience and knowledge covers a whole lot more.</p>

                <p>In fact, one of the main reasons our clients choose us is because we're not <em>just</em> user experience designers, and we're not <em>just</em> developers either. We pride ourselves on being a combination of both; sitting between both disciplines to ensure that <a href="/digital-service-design">what looks good also works well</a>.</p>

                <p>We're often asked what development languages we use &#8212; whether that's PHP, .NET, Node, React... you name it &#8212; often leaving us hesitant to answer, as that suggests we wouldn't use others. That's not the case at all. It's not about what language you use, but about selecting the <strong>most suitable tools</strong> for the job.</p>

                <p>In that regard we are <strong>completely platform agnostic</strong>. So if you'd like to explore a development project with us a little further then we should definitely <a href="/contact">have a chat</a>.</p>

                        "I was recommended to Chris by my web designer and have to say it was the best recommendation I’ve ever had. I’m a complete beginner in all things web and Chris took the time to help me understand exactly how the web development process worked. He was clear in his communications to me, got to grips with my brief, understood what I was trying to achieve and bent over backwards to meet my deadline. The support he gave me during the launch month was exceptional, no question I had was too small. Chris is very efficient and provided me (and continues to provide me) with an exceptional service. He has incredible knowledge and I am so lucky to have got to work with him. My website is amazing and the feedback I receive makes me so proud of the final product."
